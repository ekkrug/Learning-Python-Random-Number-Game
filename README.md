# Learning Python Random Number Game
In preparation for an upcoming class, I want to familiarize myself with Python. My programming language experience as of January 2019 is with C#, C++, Java, and Swift. I learned and implemented a number of different common functionalities in Python including classes, reading from/writing to files, getting and validating user input, formatting string output, and working with random numbers.
